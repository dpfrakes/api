I traveled for my company once in the past; almost immediately after starting my first job out of college. However, it was for an unnecessarily-expensive onboarding experience where no meaningful learning happened, no new business was acquired, and no employee under the age of 30 wasn't hammered at least 3 times a week. Fun for us recent college grads? Absolutely. Wise investment for the company? Not by a long shot.

With that being said, I recently returned from my first "real" business trip to the Bay Area where I was tasked with learning about an unfamiliar industry, identifying opportunities for improvement, offering my professional opinion on project structure and process modifications, and assisting in technical development.

Here are a few things I learned that I wish I had been told before starting:

1. Talk to strangers

This can be exhausting and difficult, especially for introverts - the vast majority of the "techie" population. But this is so critical for business development, especially long-term relationships. Get to know who your resources, your strategists, and your leaders are so you know who to talk to depending on what you need. Also, this is just a good habit for anyone over the age of 18.

2. Make an impression

How do you want your new coworkers or clients to describe you? There's no single right answer, but whatever your answer to this is, write it down and reflect on your progress throughout your trip. Ask yourself, "What did I do today that would make Ed describe me as a hard worker?" or "Have I given Brad a reason to respect my professional advice on project management?"

3. Explore new places

With about every single professional bio, social media profile, and dating site profile out there, it seems like this should be an easy one. Go try new restaurants, wander around town after work, and don't be afraid to be a tourist. I even managed to reuse a ridiculous selfie from a weekend trip to San Jose in a knowledge share presentation for work. And besides, where will you take that potential client to a spur-of-the-moment dinner if the only restaurant you know is the sketchy cheesesteak place around the corner from your hotel? Knowledge is power, and knowing your way around never hurts.

4. Document everything

If you're not growing you're dying. I'm sure you've heard this before, but there is a reason it has become a platitude. My fellow traveling coworker and I spent several days documenting the processes, practices, and problems with our new project. This was all second nature to the veterans, but to any new team members, there was no way of knowing they were responsible for updating assignments a particular way or asking so-and-so for files they'd never heard of. Documenting what we learned helped streamline the same process a new consultant from Houston had to undergo less than 2 weeks later.

5. Create your own value

Managers go nuts for mature workers who take initiative. If you haven't been assigned tasks, that doesn't mean you don't have work to do (sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but Facebook can wait). Documentation isn't fun, but it's an easy way for even a newbie to immediately bring something valuable to the table. Find ways to automate tasks and decrease time required to finish certain tasks. Then show it off.

6. Have a plan

Lastly, make a set of goals for yourself. Break each goal into smaller tasks - ideally ones that can be accomplished in less than a day - then set deadlines. Having a list of goals to start with can provide insight into your productivity during the trip and the accuracy of your expectations. And remember to include personal time in your plan!
