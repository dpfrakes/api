      <title>Grade Calculator</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re in school and, like me, enjoy playing the &amp;ldquo;what-if&amp;rdquo; game with your grades, you might find this fun and/or helpful.
 The faded green range shows your minimum and maximum course grade for finalized assignment/test grades. The light green range shows your &amp;ldquo;hypothetical&amp;rdquo; grade range, based on grades you enter as &amp;ldquo;not final.&amp;rdquo; Eventually I plan to make this into mobile app, but for now, Google Sheets works pretty well.</description>

      <description>In preparation for a Spartan Sprint in 2016, I subscribed to their &amp;ldquo;Workout of the Day.&amp;rdquo; I wanted to pull it up on my phone without having to go to their website or search through my inbox, so I took a closer look at the Workout of the Day web page and found an API link I might be able to use.
  You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait 13 seconds and download 10 MB of ads, images, and popups just to view 630 bytes of text.</description>

      <title>Automated Speed Test</title>

      <description>Motivation Soon after learning the basics of continuous integration at work, I decided to set up a Jenkins instance on my home server to run automated internet speed tests around the clock.
Tech Stack  Jenkins Raspberry Pi AWS DynamoDB GitHub Firebase  Code Originally, I ran these speedtests via crontab on an old Dell tower, but decided to outsource the job to a smaller, less power-hungry beast. Now, Jenkins runs the test every 15 minutes, then formats and uploads the results every hour to GitHub.</description>

      <title>Business Trip Lessons</title>

      <description>I traveled for work almost immediately after starting my first job out of college. However, it was for an unnecessarily-expensive onboarding experience where no meaningful learning happened, no new business was acquired, and no employee under the age of 30 wasn&amp;rsquo;t hammered at least 3 times a week. Fun for us recent college grads? Absolutely. Wise investment for the company? Not by a long shot.
My first &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; business trip occurred in the summer of 2016 when Blackstone Technology Group discontinued their Financial Services offering, spun off their California-based energy industry as a wholly-owned subsidiary, and sent me and one other developer (from the defunct FinTech branch) to the Bay Area for two months.</description>
